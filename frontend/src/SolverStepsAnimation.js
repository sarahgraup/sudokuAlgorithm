/**Solver Steps Animation
 * 
 * visualizes each step of sudoku solving process including assignments, 
 * conflicts, and backtracking
 * Props:
 *  - steps: An array of solver steps to animate.
 *  - currentStepIndex: Index of the current step in the animation.
 * 
 * State:
 *  - animationSpeed: Controls the speed of the animation.
 *  - isAnimating: Indicates if the animation is currently playing.
 * 
 * Functions:
    - animateStep: Animates a single step of the solving process.
    - startAnimation: Begins the animation from the current step.
    - stopAnimation: Stops the ongoing animation.
    - setAnimationSpeed: Adjusts the speed of the animation.
